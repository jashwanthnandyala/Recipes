#Recipes
Following a significant journey of learning JavaScript, I'm thrilled to share my recent project: a recipe app!
It's easy for users to bookmark, search, and add recipes to the API. This is the first time I've tried using Parcel for quick bundling, which greatly improves performance.
Under its surface, the application uses GET and POST requests to communicate with the API.
I added local storage to make the application more user-friendly by preserving data and preferences even after it has been closed.
Now these initial results prove the journey worthy... 
Here's the website link: https://rapidrecipes.netlify.app/ Please visit and don't forget to share your experience... please view both mobile and desktop versions to experience the responsiveness) 
Thank you for your time....
